Object-oriented programming uses programmer-defined types to organize both code and data. 

## 15.1 Programmer-Defined Types

Class is a type that a programmer defines.

### Class Definition
Defining a class named Point creates a class object.

Because Point is defined at the top level, it's full name is `__main__.Point`.

```
class Point:
    """Represents a point in 2-D space."""
```

### Creating Objects : Instantiation
The class object is like a factory for creating objects, which is called instances. 

```
>>> blank = Point()
>>> blank
<__main__.Point object at 0x10b47c518> # Python tells you what class it belongs to and where it is stored in memory.
```

#### Assigning Values to an instance : Attributes
*For other language, attribute and field is interchangable.*
* 모듈 안의 함수 또는 클래스 등은 각각 한 개씩 들어있지만, 인스턴스 개수 만큼 attribute가 만들어진다. 

```
>>> blank.x = 3.0
>>> blank.y = 4.0
```

Variable(*blank*) refers to a Point object, which contains attributes. Each attribute refers to data.

#### Instances as Return Values

#### Objects Are Mutable
