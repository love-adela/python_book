## The way of the program

The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem solving**.

* Problem solving : The process of formulating a problem, finding a solution, and expressing it.

### What is a program

A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.

#### Basic instructions about every language:

* input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.

* output: Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.

* math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.

* conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.

* repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

### Running Python

* Python Interpreter : It is a program that reads and executes Python code.

### The first program

* Print Statement

```
>>> print('Hello, World')
```

### Arithmetic Operators

Python provides operators, which are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.

* Example : + , - , * , /, **, ^

### Values and Types

* value :
  * >>> 1,000,000
    (1,0,0)
    Python interprets 1,000,000 as a comma-separated sequence of integers.
* type : integer, floating-point number, string


### Formal and Natural Langugages

#### Natural languages
* Any one of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.
* Such as English, Spanish, and French.
* They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them)
* They evolved naturally.

#### Formal languages
* Any one of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs; all programming languages are formal languages.
* Languages that are designed by people for specific applications.
* Such as the notation that mathematicians use at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols.
* Another example is the chemical structure of molecules. 
* **Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express compuitations.**

#### Parsing
* Parse: To examine a program and analyze the syntactic structure.

#### Features in common between formal and natural languages
* tokens : One of the basic elements of the syntactic structure of a program, analogous to a word in a nautral language.
* structure
* syntax : The rules that govern the structure of a program.

#### Differences between formal languages and natural languages
* ambiguity (애매모호함) 
  * formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.
  * natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information.
* redundancy (불필요한 중복)
  * formal languages
  * natural languages
* literalness (축어적임)
  * formal languages
  * natural languages
* poetry (시)
  * formal languages
  * natural languages
* prose (산문)
  * formal languages
  * natural languages
* programs (프로그램)
  * formal languages
  * natural languages

#### Debugging
* The process of finding and correcting bugs.
  * Bug : An error in a program.
* *There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, we respond to them the same way we resopond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, The Media Equatation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places.*

* *Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses.*
